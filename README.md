# Tesla Stock Analysis and Prediction

#  Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Tesla's stock prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical stock data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies various predictive models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to forecast future stock prices. The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

# Objectives

Analyze historical Tesla stock price data to uncover trends and insights.

Apply data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict future stock prices.

Features

Data Analysis:

Loading and exploring the dataset.

Checking for missing values and handling them.

Visualizing trends and patterns using matplotlib and seaborn.

Preprocessing:

Applying statistical techniques like winsorization to handle outliers.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

# Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression: A baseline model to predict stock prices.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method to improve prediction accuracy.

XGBoost Regressor: A gradient boosting framework for high-performance predictions.

# Performance Evaluation:

Metrics used include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) scores.

# Inferences

The dataset revealed significant trends in Tesla's stock prices, with identifiable patterns of growth over specific periods.

Outlier detection and handling improved the accuracy of predictive models.

Among the evaluated models, XGBoost outperformed others with the highest R² score and the lowest MAE, demonstrating its suitability for stock price prediction.

Visualizations provided valuable insights into price volatility, trends, and correlations with different features.

The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model selection in achieving reliable predictions.
